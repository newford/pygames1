Python game examples.

Ex3Game is a snake gamebased on the example 3 in chapter 11 in the textbook "Raspberry Pi User Guide" by Eben Upton (Wiley 2012). 
The example shows how to program in Python with the pygame module. The text is very good as a first introduction to pygame.
This implementation has some small modifications.
